                <h1>About me</h1>
                <div class="paragraph my-5">
                    <p>My name is Ilyas Benhssine, 20 year old, born in Morocco Rabat, I’m a Full Stack developer & software engineering student in the beginning of my career, i’m also a software analyste in the automotive industry</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Background</h4>
                    <p>I grew up in a moroccan blue-collar household, ever since i was a little kid, technologie & automobile were my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my playstation playing gran turismo on the Nordschleif with the Mercedes Benz Evo 2. As i went throught the races it was almost magic, being able to get a piece of plastic, some wires & electricity to lift you from your boring room to the nordschleif and drive the car of your dreams. Under the constant pression of school and house to do stuff correctly & the right way i developped perfectionism which helped me to push the limits & do the best i can, and also depriving me from feeling the satisfaction from doing stuff as i fell like i can always do better & i should do better.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Technologie</h4>
                    <p>At the age of 6 I had my own personal computer, since I was fascinated by the concept of having a machine where you can express yourself however you want, create whatever you want, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. I managed to create my first html websites. This passion carried me throughout my education. <br><br>Now in the industry, that passion stays with me. There is certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to create and build. And for that I am very grateful.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">Automobile</h4>
                    <p>Throughout elementary school, my father worked with the government, he had luxury work cars, he always waited for me in front of the school leaning on the car. I have always admired this metal machine with an intricately designed motor and 4 wheels that can take you anywhere you want quickly while comfortably seated in a leather seat.</p>
                    <!-- <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5">My Philosophy</h4>
                    <p>I was born in a religious environement that teached religious stuff (Magic, Devil, Heaven, Hell, God love us, We were created from mud and angel from light ...) it never clicked in my brain i never believed thoes stories i always saw them as some kind of old fair tails stories. I was always wondering why i’m here? why there is no clear meaning to our existance?<br><br>For me personally. I would much rather know the truth, (good or bad) then to have that wonder. Sometimes, a part of healing, and, acceptance is knowing the truth, accepting it, and, being able to come to terms with whatever the truth brings. Me personally I feel like in order to heal in a way that will be pretty beneficial to your mind at least is, knowing the truth. I have experienced situations
                        <br><br>I just where certain people really can’t handle the truth so, it only does more harm then good. Based off my own personal feelings and experiences with wanting to know the truth. (No matter what it brings) it does require an, open, and, strong mind. Or at least the mentality of wanting what the truth brings to work in your favor. That’s saying if you can handle it and not let it do more harm then good. I truly believe that if we put our minds to it. We can really accomplish or achieve (to the best of our abilities) what we believe is the action to the meaning “mind over matter” what you don’t allow to “mind” aka bother you, or affect you mentally) Then in the definition of the word it’s self “it doesn’t matter. so, to speak. I would love to hear different views, perceptions, thoughts, and, experiences with if knowing the truth helped in anyway to heal or allow you to truly move forward into taking the, what is to be believed as the steeping stones to truely healing and moving on in a way that is less damaging to the mental or at least the stability of the mind.</p> -->
